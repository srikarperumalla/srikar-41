#BEHAVIOR OF IDEAL GASES

# A gas well is producing gas with a specific gravity of 0.65 at a rate of 1.1 MMscf/day. The average reservoir pressure and temperature are 1,500 psi and 150Â°F. Calculate:
# a. Apparent molecular weight of the gas
# b. Gas density at reservoir conditions
# c. Flow rate in lb/day
